    "`pandas` (typically abbreviated as `pd`) is:\n",
    "- a library that provides, amongst other things, a very nice data structure known as the `DataFrame`\n",

    "- i.e. it allows you to do SQL-ish analysis in Python\n",
    "- it also visualizes nicely in Jupyter notebooks\n",

    "Choosing the right set of features can bring many benefits.\n",

    "Some models don't work well with redundancy, so you'll want to choose features that are not too inter-related. Additionally, some datasets contain many, many columns, and reducing the amount of inputs to your model can drastically reduce the time it takes to prep your data and train your model. \n",

    "It should be noted that, when developing predictive models, you always need to be careful to *not base your performance benchmarks off of what you're training your models on*, and that goes even for feature selection - it's one thing to look at the entire dataset when you're exploring and looking for problems, but it's another to be programmatically making decisions around what to include in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will start by taking 10% of our data out and putting it on the back burner - only for use at the very end, once we've already decided what our model and feature set are and once we're ready to just report performance estimates. We will take this 10% out _randomly_ and with respect to the _natural stratification_ of our target's clases (i.e. with respect for the balance of `True` / `False` in `over_fifty_k_bool`)."

That's how \"direction\" plays in here. As for \"magnitude\", the bigger the difference between `X` and its mean tends to be, the bigger the *covariance* between X and anything else; ditto for `Y`.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Some Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, a [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) is a model that predicts a class or label, as opposed to a numeric value - i.e. it's built for predicting categorical data. In this case, we're going to, for all intents, restrict our definitions to [binary classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification) (where our target, what we're predicting, can only take one of two values). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "A _Decision Tree_ [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) a model that builds a series of rules, kind of like the game _twenty questions_. E.g is `age >= 15`? It typically does this repeatedly until it has created a number of *pure* (or close to it) \"leaves\" or terminal nodes such that each of these nodes strongly represents a particular class value. In more detail, we train a decision tree through, basically:\n",
    "- iterating through the available features and the available values for each of those features\n",
    "- evaluating the effectiveness of each of those feature values when it comes to splitting the data into groups that represent a particular class\n",
    "- selecting the most effective feature-value rule (e.g. `age >= 30`) or \"splitting rule\" and splitting the data based on that rule\n",
    "- we then apply the same process to each of the resultant groups (e.g. `age >= 30` and `age < 30`) and continue doing so until we have found our \"pure\" nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a pure node? The idea is that, once our tree is built (i.e. trained), we can make a prediction through propagating a data point through the rules in the tree (e.g. `age >= 30`, `sex == Female`) until we've reached a partition of the data that, in our training, we found to be associated with one particular class. We then return the class associated with our final partition as our \"prediction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What's been described has been maybe a little bit simplified but should provide a good idea of the foundational concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Splitting Rule Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Purity here refers to the distributional concentration of the data towards a particular class. Put differently, we can think about the probability of how often a randomly chosen item would be mislabeled, if all we had to go off was the class probabilities across the entirety of the given data. To calculate this number, we must account for the following:\n",
    "- probability of drawing a random item with a certain class label (let's call this `p`)\n",
    "- probability that this data will have come from another class (this is in fact `1 - p`)\n",
    "\n",
    "(this is of course assuming that a given data point can belong to exactly one class.) Since these two conditions are independent, we simply multiply them together, yielding:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p \\cdot (1 - p) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and at a given node, we can sum this result across all classes to get what's called [Gini impurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity), which provides a good measure for the effectiveness of a given splitting rule in partitioning the data according to its class labels. Now that we have a good measure for splitting rule effectiveness, we can choose our splitting rule such that it provides the greatest reduction in impurity from the previous node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our impurity function is concave, with a maximum when class probabilities are equal, and a minimum when all except for one class's probabilities are zero. I.e. nodes are the least pure when they consist of an equal proportion for each class, and nodes are the purest when they contain only one class, and the more a rule leads us to more pure nodes, the better the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree Depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we let a decision tree grow, uninhibited, until all of its leaves are pure, we will likely end up with a tree that has *overfit*, i.e. it is so tightly coupled to the data it was trained on that it won't generalize well. Thus, we will often implement something to prevent the tree from becoming too deep, through setting something like a specific number of levels that a tree can't exceed, or a minimum number of items that can end up in a leaf / terminal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's a *Random Forest*? The idea is that, in trying to prevent overfitting, we build a whole bunch of decision trees, such that each tree is a little bit different, and take the average across all these trees' votes to produce a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a little more detail, a [random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) generally relies on the following procedures in order to ensure that there is *variance* across its trees' structures:\n",
    "- each tree is based off its own [bootstrap sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest#Bagging), or random resampling with replacement, of the underlying data\n",
    "- a random subset of the available features will be used each time a new splitting rule is to be defined\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that random forests are models for which it is desirable to limit redundancy in features, as redundant features will limit the effectiveness of creating a number of different trees using random subsets of the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are going to use a random forest for? We're actually going to build a machine learning model, and retrain it to different subsets of the feature space, and use feature contributions to help us determine what our most useful features are.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to set this forest to build 10 trees (in practice, it's good to use 100), and pass another argument for `class_weight`, which we'll get to in a bit:"

    "Now, we'll use something called the *recursive feature eliminator* (`RFE`) to help us determine which features are worth keeping. In practice, [permutation importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html) is the preferred method for this, but the `RFE` is kind of an intuitive and interesting trick to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the `RFE` works is as follows:\n",
    "- we pass it a model to use (in our case, `rf`) as well as the number of features we're looking to keep (in our case, `10`)\n",
    "- then, we fit it to some data\n",
    "- from there, it will evaluate the effectiveness of each feature, and it will eliminate the least effective feature\n",
    "- it will then continue this process, [recursively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) (hence its name), until the desired number of features remain\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it determine the effectiveness of each feature? It actually leans on the inputted model for that, and what the random forest uses is Gini impurity - it will look across each split in each of its trees, sum up the reductions to impurity, by feature, and return these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why is *permutation importance* preferred? Because relying on Gini to interpret features can lead to results that favor features with a high [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality). But, the interpretability of tree-based models is interesting and is worth learning about, and we'll work with that method here."

In cross-validation, we break the data into chunks or \"folds\" - for the sake of example, let's say 5. We take 4 of those folds and use them to train a model, and test that model on the other fold (or \"hold-out\" or \"test\" fold). Then, we repeat that process, inserting the previous test fold back into the train set, and taking a different train fold out as the test set. We do this until we've tested on all 5 folds and then typically report the average (and maybe standard deviation) performance across these folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional details:\n",
    "- cross validation (CV) is often referred to as *k-fold cross validation*, where `k` represents the number of folds used (in the above example, 5)\n",
    "- the data is typically sampled randomly into the k folds\n",
    "- in classification, [stratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling) random sampling is used, such that the given class distributions are preserved within each fold\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this whole process is kind of like what we did above, with our \"hold-out\" set that we're using for our final, reported performance estimates, except that we are repeating the process several times. Why?\n",
    "- we can evaluate the model's performance across every provided data point (as we test on every fold)\n",
    "- we avoid ever evaluating the model's results on the data that it was trained it on\n",

    "There's actually a great concept that encapsulates this relationship, and that's the [bias-variance tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff). The idea is that, generally speaking, there's a tradeoff between a model being correct and a model being consistent. A model that will, at least on some data, predict certain data with high accuracy may offer much worse performance on other data (i.e. there's \"variance\" in its performance). On the other hand, a model that is restricted from building a tight fit to any particular data may produce predictions that are wrong (or \"biased\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate fit by comparing our train scores to the test scores. In other words, in addition to retaining performance on each of our hold out sets, we also retain performance when predicting the data the model is trained on. We must **never** report train scores, but they can prove useful when compared to test scores. If there's a large disparity - let's say, greater than 5% - then the model is likely overfitting.\n",
    "\n",

Most models have some *hyper-parameters* - parameters you pass to the model creation process, as opposed to the data that you pass to the model fitting proces - that will restict a model from establishing too tight of a fit. With *logistic regression*, you can control [regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)) in order to force the model's coefficients to stay near 0. With a random forest, you can control the [depth of a tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_pruning)."

    "Wow - a big difference! By the way, if we wanted to evaluate based on limiting the size of the leaves in the trees, as opposed to explicitly limiting the depth of the tree, you could tweak the `min_samples_leaf` hyper-parameter. These methods are probably pretty comparable in practice but maybe offer different interpretations, each of which might fit certain datasets or problems better.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good tecnhique is to evaluate a model's performance over different hyper-parameter values. `sklearn` has [implemented](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) something called `GridSearchCV`, which will perform an exhaustive search over the different parameter values you pass. This is a great tool, and makes setting up automated build pipelines much easier.\n",

    "You can see that, as we lower our decision threshold, we increase our recall at the expense of our precision. Based on what we're seeing I might set our decision threshold at 65% or .65 - the default is typically 50%. This step is not always necessary but can prove helpful when classes are imbalanced (as ours are, although the 3:1 class ratios we have are not that severe). This is generally a step you'd take in a pretty imblanced problem after you had put some effort into model tuning."

    "### Model Selection, Additional Details\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many models to choose from, with each providing its own strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler models lead to reduced odds of overfitting, quicker build times, and easier debugging when problems occur. For example, [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression#:~:text=Logistic%20regression%20is%20a%20statistical,a%20form%20of%20binary%20regression), which basically entails wrapping a linear regression model with the *logit* function (squashing output to be between 0 and 1 so that it can be interpreted as a probability), is considered a very simple model. As an added bonus, if you need to go beyond class labels and into class probabilities, logistic regession naturally does a great job there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex models, while sometimes useful or even necessary, can bring the burdens of potential overfitting, more hyperparameters to tune, longer train times, and more complicated debugging procedures. They can sometimes deliver much stronger results (see: the world of [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)). Often it comes down to bias & variance: would you rather have your model be wrong, but conistent, or sometimes very right and sometimes very wrong? Generally, it's somewhere in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, data preparation plays a part, too. With any model that involves taking a linear combination of features (e.g. logistic regression, or the internals of a [multilayer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)), pre-treating continuous data so that its values are [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) (to be between 0 and 1) is very important. So is reducing skewness. Additionally, you must worry about outliers. And of course, missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a random forest, you do not need to worry about feature scaling or skewness. You also don't really need to worry about outliers (since the tree works through splitting, and not multiplying and adding). Ditto for missing data, as long as you encode it correctly. That's not to say that you shouldn't have an understanding of the source of your data quality issues, just that you don't have to worry about coding around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, RF models take some of the fun out of creative data prep, but they take some of the work out, too!"
