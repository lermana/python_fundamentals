    "- a library that provides, amongst other things, a very nice data structure known as the `DataFrame`\n",
    "- the `DataFrame` is a relational / tabular data structure\n",
    "- i.e. it allows you to do SQL-ish analysis in Python\n",
    "- it also visualizes nicely in Jupyter notebooks\n",

You are welcome to check out, and _use_ the code, which you can find [here](https://github.com/lermana/indoorplants). Editor's note: this library is still being developed ... in other words, your mileage may vary. If you would like to make use of my code in the seminar, you should click the aforermentioned link, and go ahead and `git clone` that repo, and then follow the brief installation instructions there. Otherwise, you can simply comment out the lines that mention that repo with a `#` (there aren't that many)."

We generally pick some kind of scoring metric, and then run several trials using different samplings of the data, and use the highest aggregate (usually through taking the _mean_) score across these trials as an indiciation of us having found the best model (it can help to think of _deviation_ throughout the trials, too).\n",

We take 4 of those chunks and use them to train a model, and test that model on the _other_ chunk, and retain that score value. Then, you repeat that process, taking your previous test chunk back into the train set, and taking a different train chunk out for the test set. You do this until you've tested on all 5 chunks and then typically report the average (and maybe standard deviation) across these trials.\n",

    "### Why I like Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many models to choose from, with each providing their own strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler models lead to reduced odds of overfitting, quicker build times, and easier debugging when problems occur. For example, _logistic regression_, which basically entials wrapping a linear regression model with the _logit_ function, which squashes output to between 0 and 1, is considered a very simple model (bonus: it naturally produces great probabilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex models bring the burdens of potential overfitting, more hyperparameters to tune, longer train times, etc. But they can sometimes deliver much stronger results (see: the world of neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times it comes down to what's known as the _bias-variance trade-off_: would you rather have your model be wrong, but conistent? Or sometimes very right, and sometimes very wrong? Generally, it's somewhere in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, data preparation plays a part, too. With any model that involves taking a linear combination of feautes (e.g. logistic regression, or the internals of a multi-layer perceptron), pre-treating your continuous data so that its values are _normalized_ (between 0 and 1) is very important. So is reducing skewness. Additionally, you must worry about outliers. And of course, missing data...\n",
    "\n",
    "With a random forest, you do not need to worry about feature scaling or skewness. You also don't need to worry about outliers (since the tree works through _splitting_, and not multiplying and adding). Ditto for missing data, as long as you encode it correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, RF models take some of the fun out creative data prep, but they also make it very straightforward to get going."
